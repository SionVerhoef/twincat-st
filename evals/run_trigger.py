"""Run skill-creator's trigger evaluation or description optimizer, with every
`claude -p` call isolated in a throwaway project of its own.

    python3 evals/run_trigger.py check    --skill-creator DIR --model <id> [run_eval options]
    python3 evals/run_trigger.py optimize --skill-creator DIR --model <id> [run_loop options]

DIR is the skill-creator skill folder (the one holding scripts/run_eval.py); it can
also come from $SKILL_CREATOR_DIR. --eval-set defaults to evals/trigger-evals.json and
--skill-path to this repository. `check` scores the current description once;
`optimize` also rewrites it. Neither touches SKILL.md — copy a winner in by hand.

What the stock scripts get wrong, and this wrapper fixes:

  * Every parallel worker writes its temporary command into one shared
    .claude/commands/ folder, so each session sees its siblings' identical copies,
    plus any a killed run left behind. A trigger of a sibling's copy scores as a
    miss: the first full optimizer run here reported 0% recall for that reason.
  * Each call leaves a transcript folder in the operator's Claude Code project
    history. The wrapper deletes the one its call created.
  * Run from inside this repository, every call would also load its CLAUDE.md,
    which talks about TwinCAT and biases the queries toward triggering.

Starting a session takes 40-50 s here, so pass --timeout 180 and keep --num-workers
around 5; the default 30 s times every call out and scores it as a miss.

Known limit: the calls still load the operator's global Claude Code settings, so
other installed skills compete with this one, as they would in real use.
